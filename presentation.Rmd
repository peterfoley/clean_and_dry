## Tips

Always helpful:

  - `usethis::use_git`

Utility scripts:
  - no side effects
  - don't source other utility scripts -- keep it flat
  - 

## Work log

Script log:
 - first goal was to get the activity traces downloaded and read into R
    - ifirst tried reading as .fit files, but those didn't load traces well
    - switched to .gpx format, and `plotKML::readGPX` loads those very quickly but breaks extension fields like heart rate
    - fell back to directly processing gpx files with mix of xml2 and purrr
  - then wanted to plot just the dog walks
    - filtered down to the usual walk route, and then manually dropped some activities
    - needed to calculate and expand bounding boxes to get pretty maps around the traces
